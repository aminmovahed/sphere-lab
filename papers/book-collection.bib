@article{Khalid:2013a,
	Abstract = {This paper presents a general framework for spatially-varying spectral filtering of signals defined on the unit sphere, as an analogy to joint time-frequency filtering. For this purpose, we first map spherical signals from spatial domain into joint spatio-spectral domain, where a spatio-spectral signal transformation or modification is introduced. For mapping spatial signals into joint spatio-spectral domain, we use the spatially localized spherical harmonic transform (SLSHT) from the literature. We then propose a suitable scheme to transform the modified signal from the spatio-spectral domain back to an admissible signal in the spatial domain using the least squares approach. We also show that the overall action of the SLSHT and spatio-spectral signal modification can be described through a single transformation matrix, which is useful in practice. Finally, we discuss two specific and useful instances of spatially-varying spectral filtering, defined through multiplicative and convolutive modification of the SLSHT distribution, and show through numerical examples their effectiveness in selective spectral filtering of different spatial regions of the signal.},

	Abstract = {A concept of generalized discrepancy, which involves pseudodifferential operators to give a criterion of equidistributed pointsets, is developed on the sphere. A simply structured formula in terms of elementary functions is established for the computation of the generalized discrepancy. With the help of this formula five kinds of point systems on the sphere, namely lattices in polar coordinates, transformed two-dimensional sequences, rotations on the sphere, triangulations, and "sum of three squares sequence," are investigated. Quantitative tests are done, and the results are compared with one another. Our calculations exhibit different orders of convergence of the generalized discrepancy for different types of point systems.},

@article{Sadeghi:2012,
	Abstract = {We develop a new type of convolution between two signals on the 2-sphere. This is the first type of convolution on the 2-sphere which is commutative. Two other advantages, in comparison with existing definitions in the literature, are that 1) the new convolution admits anisotropic filters and signals and 2) the domain of the output remains on the sphere. Therefore, the new convolution well emulates the conventional Euclidean convolution. In addition to providing the new definition of convolution and discussing its properties, we provide the spectral analysis of the convolution output. This convolutional framework can be useful in filtering applications for signals defined on the 2-sphere.},

	Abstract = {Recently, the commutative anisotropic convo- lution has been defined for signals defined on the 2-sphere. Here, we present exact and efficient methods for compu- tation of commutative convolution of two signals defined on the sphere. For the fast computation of commutative convolution, we first review the use of existing efficient techniques developed to evaluate SO(3) convolution. By employing the factoring of a rotation into two rotations, followed by the separation of variables, we propose the fast algorithm for the efficient computation of commutative convolution. In terms of computational complexity, our proposed algorithm provides the saving of O(N) over the existing algorithms, where the convolution output is evaluated on O(N2) samples on the 2-sphere. Through numerical experiments, we also verify the improvement in the computational complexity.},

	Abstract = {The primary objective of the Mars Observer laser altimeter (MOLA) investigation is to determine globally the topography of Mars at a level suitable for addressing problems in geology and geophysics. Secondary objectives are to characterize the 1064-nm wavelength surface reflectivity of Mars to contribute to analyses of global surface mineralogy and seasonal albedo changes, to assist in addressing problems in atmospheric circulation, and to provide geodetic control and topographic context for the assessment of possible future Mars landing sites. The principal components of MOLA are a diode-pumped, neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet laser transmitter that emits 1064-nm wavelength laser pulses, a 0.5-m-diameter telescope, a silicon avalanche photodiode detector, and a time interval unit with 10-ns resolution. MOLA will provide measurements of the topography of Mars within approximately 160-m footprints and a center-to-center along-track footprint spacing of 300 m along the Mars Observer subspacecraft ground track. The elevation measurements will be quantized with 1.5 m vertical resolution before correction for orbit- and pointing-induced errors. MOLA profiles will be assembled into a global 0.2deg x 0.2deg grid that will be referenced to Mars' center of mass with an absolute accuracy of approximately 30 m. Other data products will include a global grid of topographic gradients, corrected individual profiles, and a global 0.2deg x 0.2deg grid of 1064-nm surface reflectivity.},

	Abstract = {We develop a novel sampling theorem on the sphere and corresponding fast algorithms by associating the sphere with the torus through a periodic extension. The fundamental property of any sampling theorem is the number of samples required to represent a band-limited signal. To represent exactly a signal on the sphere band-limited at L, all sampling theorems on the sphere require O(L2) samples. However, our sampling theorem requires less than half the number of samples of other equiangular sampling theorems on the sphere and an asymptotically identical, but smaller, number of samples than the Gauss-Legendre sampling theorem. The complexity of our algorithms scale as O(L3), however, the continual use of fast Fourier transforms reduces the constant prefactor associated with the asymptotic scaling considerably, resulting in algorithms that are fast. Furthermore, we do not require any precomputation and our algorithms apply to both scalar and spin functions on the sphere without any change in computational complexity or computation time. We make our implementation of these algorithms available publicly and perform numerical experiments demonstrating their speed and accuracy up to very high band-limits. Finally, we highlight the advantages of our sampling theorem in the context of potential applications, notably in the field of compressive sampling.},

	Abstract = {Spherical harmonics serve as basis functions on the unit sphere and spherical harmonic transform is required in analysis and processing of signals in the spectral domain. We investigate the possibility of parallel computation of spherical harmonic transform using Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) with no communication between parallel kernels. We identify the parallel components in the widely used spherical harmonic transform method proposed by Driscoll and Healy. We provide the implementation details and compare the computational complexity with the sequential algorithm. For a given bandlimited signal with maximum spherical harmonics degree L, using the O(L) number of parallel processing kernels, we present that the spherical harmonic coefficients can be calculated in O(L log^2 L) time as compared to $O(L^2 log^2 L). For corroboration, we provide the simulation results using CUDA which indicate the reduction in computational complexity.},

@article{Khalid:2012,
	Abstract = {This correspondence studies a spatially localized spectral transform for signals on the unit sphere, which we call spatially localized spherical harmonics transform (SLSHT). For a systematic treatment, we explicitly express the transform in terms of rotated versions of an azimuthally symmetric window function and introduce the spatio-spectral SLSHT distribution with a succinct matrix representation. We present guidelines for the choice of the window function in the SLSHT, based on the inherent trade-off between the spatial and spectral resolution of different window functions from the perspective of the uncertainty principle. We demonstrate the use of an eigenfunction window, obtained from the Slepian concentration problem on the sphere, as a good choice for window function. As an illustration, we apply the transform to the topographic map of Mars, which can reveal spatially-localized spectral contributions that were not obtainable from traditional spherical harmonics analysis.},

	Abstract = {The large spectral efficiencies promised for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless fading channels are derived under certain conditions which do not fully take into account the spatial aspects of the channel. Spatial correlation, due to limited angular spread or insufficient antenna spacing, significantly reduces the performance of MIMO systems. In this paper we explore the effects of spatially selective channels on the capacity of MIMO systems via a new capacity expression which is more general and realistic than previous expressions. By including spatial information we derive a closed-form expression for ergodic capacity which uses the physics of signal propagation combined with the statistics of the scattering environment. This expression gives the capacity of a MIMO system in terms of antenna placement and scattering environment and leads to valuable insights into the factors determining capacity for a wide range of scattering models.},

Such signals may be completely reconstructed from a finite number of uniformly spaced signal samples taken over a period, a property which facilitates the representation of two-dimensional (polar form) signals used in computerized tomography. By employing a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) setting, a generalized theorem for sampling harmonic-limited signals is derived. All the special representations which have appeared in the literature with separate proofs, including three recent versions, [1]-[3], are shown to be special cases of the generalized reconstruction formula. Connections with Fourier series theory and Kramer's generalized sampling theorem are also discussed.},

	Abstract = {Presented here are the main techniques necessary to understand rotations in three dimensions, for use with global visualisation and aerospace simulations. Relevant techniques can be extremely difficult to find in textbooks, so some useful examples are collected here to highlight these techniques.
The three standard aerospace coordinate systems are described and built using rotations. The mathematics of rotations is described, using both matrices and quaternions. The necessary calculations are given for analysing standard scenarios that involve the Global Positioning Satellite system for finding line- of-sight directions on Earth, as well as for visualising the world from a cockpit, and for converting to and from the standard software protocol for distributed interactive simulation environments.
Appendices then discuss combining rotations, conversions with a particular type of Euler angle convention, the dangers of confusing Euler angles with incremental rotations for software writers, and finally there is a short dicussion of interpolation of rotations in computing.},

	Abstract = {The problem of estimating the nominal direction of arrival and angular spread of a source surrounded by a large number of local scatterers using an array of sensors is addressed. This type of propagation occurs frequently in, for example, mobile communications. The maximum likelihood estimator is considered and two computationally less complex estimators are also proposed. They are based on least-squares fits of the sample covariance to the theoretical covariance matrix derived from the measurement model. The performance of the least-squares-based algorithm is analyzed and based on this, an optimally weighted least-squares criterion is proposed. The weighted least-squares algorithm is shown to be asymptotically efficient. Results of numerical experiments are presented to indicate small sample behavior of the estimators. The nominal direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimates are compared with those provided by a standard subspace algorithm. Finally, the methods are applied to experimental array data to determine spread angles for non line of sight scenarios.},

	Abstract = {We study the dimensions or degrees of freedom of farfield multipath that is observed in a limited, source-free region of space. The multipath fields are studied as solutions to the wave equation in an infinite-dimensional vector space. We prove two universal upper bounds on the truncation error of fixed and random multipath fields. A direct consequence of the derived bounds is that both fixed and random multipath fields have an effective finite dimension. This finite dimension is linearly proportional to the radius of the two-dimensional spatial region where the field is coupled to. We use the Karhunen-Loeve (KL) expansion of random multipath fields to quantify the notion of multipath richness. The multipath richness is defined as the number of significant eigenvalues in the KL expansion that achieves 99\% of the total multipath energy. We prove a lower bound on the largest multipath eigenvalue and use this bound to show that reducing the angular range of multipath power spectrum reduces multipath richness. We also provide a systematic numerical algorithm to find multipath eigenvalues, which unlike the Fredholm equation, does not require selecting quadrature points.},

	Abstract = {Multiple-antenna systems that are limited by the area and geometry of antenna arrays, are considered. Given these physical constraints, the limit on the available number of spatial degrees of freedom is derived. The commonly used statistical multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) model is inadequate. Antenna theory is applied to take into account the area and geometry constraints, and to define the spatial signal space so as to interpret experimental channel measurements in an array-independent but manageable description of the physical environment. Based on these modeling strategies, for a spherical array of effective aperture A in a physical environment of angular spread |\Omega| in solid angle, the number of spatial degrees of freedom is shown to be A|\Omega| for uni-polarized antennas and 2A|\Omega| for tri-polarized antennas. Together with the 2WT degrees of freedom for a system of bandwidth W transmitting in an interval T, the total degrees of freedom of a multiple-antenna channel is therefore 4WTA|\Omega|.},

@article{Fleury:2000,
	Abstract = {We present analytical results relating to first- and second-moment characterization of direction dispersion and spatial selectivity in the radio channel as well as to the duality between these two effects. Dispersion in direction can be characterized either by the direction power spectrum or by a family of spatial Doppler power spectra at the reception site. Two measures called the direction spread and the maximum spatial Doppler spread are introduced which describe the extent of channel dispersion in direction and in spatial Doppler frequency, respectively. Both measures are analogous to the delay and Doppler spreads, which are commonly employed to describe the extent of dispersion in delay and Doppler frequency, respectively. The relationships between the two approaches for characterizing spatial dispersion and especially between the direction and maximum spatial Doppler spreads are analytically established. The coherence distance at a certain level summarizes certain features of space selectivity in the radio channel which impact on the performance of communication systems. Two uncertainty relations between the direction spread and the coherence distance as well as between the maximum spatial Doppler spread and the coherence distance express the duality between direction dispersion and space selectivity. These relations are analogous to those established previously between the delay spread and the coherence bandwidth and between the Doppler spread and the coherence time. Examples relevant to mobile communications in the case where the waves propagate only horizontally illustrate the theoretical results. An application of these results to the design of uniform linear antenna arrays is also discussed},

	Abstract = {Wireless communication occurs through continuous fields, over regions of space. Although the communication channel may be modelled in terms of infinite dimensional vector spaces, it is paramount to develop finite dimensional approximations for this channel. We extend previous work which examined the fundamental finite dimensionality of fields over a finite region of space to incorporate restricted angles of signal arrival. By considering a subspace of fields where direction of arrival of the field components, or source spatial distribution, is restricted we show the received field dimensionality is linearly related to the product of the radius of the region of interest and the angular restriction. This result provides a rigourous foundation for analysing the performance and capacity of MIMO systems in non isotropic environments. The proof is presented for the two dimensional case. It is apparent that this work can be extended to the case of three dimensions for a similar result},

@article{Bello:1963,
	Abstract = {This paper is concerned with various aspects of the characterization of randomly time-variant linear channels. At the outset it is demonstrated that time-varying linear channels (or filters) may be characterized in an interesting symmetrical manner in time and frequency variables by arranging system functions in (timefrequency) dual pairs. Following this a statistical characterization of randomly time-variant linear channels is carried out in terms of correlation functions for the various system functions. These results are specialized by considering three classes of practically interesting channels. These are the wide-sense stationary (WSS) channel, the uncorrelated scattering (US) channel, and the wide-sense stationary uncorrelated scattering (WSSUS) channel. The WSS and US channels are shown to be (time-frequency) duals. Previous discussions of channel correlation functions and their relationships have dealt exclusively with the WSSUS channel. The point of view presented here of dealing with the dually related system functions and starting with the unrestricted linear channels is considerably more general and places in proper perspective previous results on the WSSUS channel. Some attention is given to the problem of characterizing radio channels. A model called the Quasi-WSSUS channel is presented to model the behavior of such channels. All real-life channels and signals have an essentially finite number of degrees of freedom due to restrictions on time duration and bandwidth. This fact may be used to derive useful canonical channel models with the aid of sampling theorems and power series expansions. Several new canonical channel models are derived in this paper, some of which are dual to those of Kailath.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we study the effect of directional random scattering on the capacity of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. First, we use the spatial decomposition of the MIMO channel matrix to analyze the randomness (entropy)  of directional scattering. The analysis shows that directional scatterers (with at least a null in the angular power spectrum) will no longer be random when the receiver observation radius is sufficiently large. Therefore, directional scattering limits the expected linear increase of MIMO capacity with increasing the number of antennas. Second, we consider the effect of receiver antenna arrangement (positions) on the capacity of MIMO systems. For any random scatterer with a given angular power spectrum, we show that it is possible to choose the receiver antenna arrangement with the optimum whitening of the MIMO channel matrix that, in turn, maximizes MIMO channel capacity.},

	Abstract = {Most array processing algorithms are based on the assumption that the signals are generated by point sources. This is a mathematical constraint that is not satisfied in many applications. In this paper, we consider situations where the sources are distributed in space with a parametric angular cross-correlation kernel. We propose an algorithm that estimates the parameters of this model using a generalization of the MUSIC algorithm. The method involves maximizing a cost function that depends on a matrix array manifold and the noise eigenvectors. We study two particular cases: coherent and incoherent spatial source distributions. The spatial correlation function for a uniformly distributed signal is derived. From this, we find the array gain and show that (in contrast to point sources) it does not increase linearly with the number of sources. We compare our method to the conventional (point source) MUSIC algorithm. The simulation studies show that the new method outperforms the MUSIC algorithm by reducing the estimation bias and the standard deviation for scenarios with distributed sources. It is also shown that the threshold signal-to-noise ratio required for resolving two closely spaced distributed sources is considerably smaller for the new method},

	Abstract = {We establish that an arbitrary narrowband multipath field in any circular region in two dimensional space has an intrinsic functional dimensionality of (/spl pi/e)R//spl lambda/, /spl ap/8.54R//spl lambda/, that scales only linearly with radius R/spl bsol//spl lambda/ in wavelengths. This result implies that there is no such thing as an arbitrarily complicated multipath field. That is, a field generated by any number of nearfield and farfield, specular and diffuse, multipath reflections is no more complicated than a field generated by a limited number of plane waves. As such, there are limits on how rich multipath can be. This result has significant implications including: i) means to determine a parsimonious parameterization for arbitrary multipath fields; ii) means of synthesizing arbitrary multipath fields with arbitrarily located nearfield or farfield, spatially discrete or continuous sources. We give examples of multipath field analysis and synthesis.},

	Abstract = {This chapter reviews our current knowledge of the gravity and topography of the terrestrial planets and describes the methods that are used to analyze these data. First, a general review of the mathematical formalism that is used in describing the properties of gravitational fields and topography is given. Next, the basic properties of the gravity and topography of the Earth, Venus, Mars, and the Moon are characterized. Following this, the relationship between gravity and topography is quantified, and techniques by which geophysical parameters can be constrained are detailed. Such analysis methods include crustal thickness modeling, the analysis of geoid/topography ratios, and modeling of the spectral admittance and correlation functions. Finally, the major results that have been obtained by modeling the gravity and topography of the Earth, Venus, Mars, and the Moon are summarized.},

	Abstract = {The fundamental limitation of using a spatial channel as an information bearing resource is considered. Such theoretical foundations are largely absent in the development of wireless communication systems which unduly focus on implementation and as a consequence there are a number of misconceptions and mal-implementations of communication systems which employ the MIMO principle. The notion of essential dimensionality of spatial systems is examined in detail for the case of a spherical region in three dimensional space in a nearfield scattering environment as a pointer to a more general theory nearing completion. A non-trivial but tight analogy is drawn with the classical work on time-frequency concentration and the dimensionality of essentially time- and band-limited signals by Slepian, Landau and Pollack.???

Specifically, he simplified and extended David Hilbert's results in the theory of integral equations; and he formalized Hilbert's distinct ideas on integral equations into the single concept of a Hilbert space, in the process introducing many geometrical terms. In addition he made contributions in the fields of partial differential equations and geometry. The most important of these discoveries were the extensions of the isoperimetric inequality, first to n-dimensional Euclidean space and then to multidimensional hyperbolic and spherical spaces. Although his methods were classical rather than abstractionist, nevertheless he must be considered a founder of modern functional analysis.},

	Abstract = {We compute the angular power spectrum C_l from the BATSE 3B catalog of 1122 gamma-ray bursts, and find no evidence for clustering on any scale. These constraints bridge the entire range from small scales (which probe source clustering and burst repetition) to the largest scales (which constrain possible anisotropies from the Galactic halo or from nearby cosmological large scale structures). We develop an analysis technique that takes the angular position errors into account, which enables us to place tight upper limits on the clustering down to scales l\approx 60, corresponding to a few degrees on the sky. The minimum-variance burst weighting that we employ is graphically visualized as an all-sky map where each burst is smeared out by an amount corresponding to its position uncertainty. We also present separate band-pass filtered sky maps for the quadrupole term and for the multipole-ranges l=3-10 and l=11-30, so that the fluctuations on different angular scales can be separately inspected for visual features such as localized ``hot spots" or structures aligned with the Galactic plane. These filtered maps reveal no apparent deviations from isotropy.},

	Abstract = {A new formalism is derived for the analysis and exact reconstruction of band-limited signals on the sphere with directional wavelets. It represents an evolution of a previously developed wavelet formalism developed by Antoine & Vandergheynst and Wiaux et al. The translations of the wavelets at any point on the sphere and their proper rotations are still defined through the continuous three-dimensional rotations. The dilations of the wavelets are directly defined in harmonic space through a new kernel dilation, which is a modification of an existing harmonic dilation. A family of factorized steerable functions with compact harmonic support which are suitable for this kernel dilation are first identified. A scale-discretized wavelet formalism is then derived, relying on this dilation. The discrete nature of the analysis scales allows the exact reconstruction of band-limited signals. A corresponding exact multi-resolution algorithm is finally described and an implementation is tested. The formalism is of interest notably for the denoising or the deconvolution of signals on the sphere with a sparse expansion in wavelets. In astrophysics, it finds a particular application for the identification of localized directional features in the cosmic microwave background data, such as the imprint of topological defects, in particular, cosmic strings, and for their reconstruction after separation from the other signal components.},

The wavelets are intrinsically defined on them-sphere and are independent of the choice of coordinate system. In addition, they may be orthogonalized easily, if desired. We will discuss decomposition, reconstruction, and localization for these wavelets. In the special case of the 2-sphere, we derive an uncertainty principle that expresses the trade-off between localization and the presence of high harmonics---or high frequencies---in expansions in spherical harmonics.

	Abstract = {Shift and rotation invariance properties of linear time-frequency representations are investigated. It is shown that among all linear time-frequency representations, only the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) family with the Hermite-Gaussian kernels satisfies both the shift invariance and rotation invariance properties that are satisfied by the Wigner distribution (WD). By extending the time-bandwidth product (TBP) concept to fractional Fourier domains, a generalized time-bandwidth product (GTBP) is defined. For mono-component signals, it is shown that GTBP provides a rotation independent measure of compactness. Similar to the TBP optimal STFT, the GTBP optimal STFT that causes the least amount of increase in the GTBP of the signal is obtained. Finally, a linear canonical decomposition of the obtained GTBP optimal STFT analysis is presented to identify its relation to the rotationally invariant STFT.},

Although the basic notions have been developing steadily over the last 40 years, there have recently been significant advances.

No simplifying assumptions are made other than band limitation. This reduces typical computation times for convolving the full sky with the asymmetric beam pattern of a megapixel cosmic microwave background (CMB) mission from months to minutes. Our methods enable realistic simulation and careful analysis of data from such missions, taking into account the effects of asymmetric ``point spread functions'' and far side lobes of the physical beam. While motivated by CMB studies, our methods are general and hence applicable to the convolution or filtering of any scalar field on the sphere with an arbitrary, asymmetric kernel. We show in an Appendix that the same ideas can be applied to the inverse problems of map-making and beam reconstruction by similarly accelerating the transpose convolution which is needed for the iterative solution of the normal equations.},

@article{Wiaux:2006,
	Abstract = {A fast algorithm is developed for the directional correlation of scalar band-limited signals and band-limited steerable filters on the sphere. The asymptotic complexity associated with it through simple quadrature is of order O(L^5), where 2L stands for the square root of the number of sampling points on the sphere, also setting a band limit L for the signals and filters considered. The filter steerability allows us to compute the directional correlation uniquely in terms of direct and inverse scalar spherical harmonics transforms, which drive the overall asymptotic complexity. The ``separation of variables'' technique for a scalar spherical harmonics transform produces an O(L^3) algorithm independent of the pixelization. On equiangular pixelizations, a sampling theorem introduced by Driscoll and Healy implies the exactness of the algorithm. The equiangular and HEALPix implementations are compared in terms of memory requirements, computation times, and numerical stability. The computation times for the scalar transform, and hence for the directional correlation, of maps of several megapixels on the sphere (L\approx 10^3) are reduced from years to tens of seconds in both implementations on a single standard computer. These generic results for the scale-space signal processing on the sphere are specifically developed in the perspective of the wavelet analysis of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature (T) and polarization (E and B) maps of the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe and Planck experiments. As an illustration, we consider the computation of the wavelet coefficients of a simulated temperature map of several megapixels with the second Gaussian derivative wavelet.},

The analysis uses the spherical Fourier transform and the spherical convolution, where it is shown that the amplitudes of the incident plane waves can be calculated as a spherical convolution between the pressure on the sphere and another function which depends on frequency and the sphere radius. The spatial resolution of plane-wave decomposition given limited bandwidth in the spherical Fourier domain is formulated, and ways to improve the computation efficiency of plane-wave decomposition are introduced.

	Abstract = {This paper introduces a quadratic variational framework for solving a broad class of signal design problems on the 2-sphere. The functional, to be extremized, combines energy concentration measures using a weighting function in the spatial domain, multiplicative weights in the spectral domain, and a total energy constraint. This leads to two formulations of the signal design problem on the 2- sphere, one a Fredholm integral equation in the spatial domain and the other an infinite matrix equation in the spectral domain. The framework is illustrated by deriving the key equations for the two classical spatio-spectral concentration problems on the 2-sphere, and for an isotropic filter design that maximizes the filtered energy. In addition, using the proposed framework, we formulate a joint 3- D beamforming application which achieves optimal directivity and spatial resolution simultaneously.},

	Abstract = {Wavelets have proven to be powerful bases for use in numericalanalysis and signal processing. Their power lies in the fact thatthey only require a small number of coefficients to represent gen-eral functions and large data sets accurately. This allows compres-sion and efficient computations. Classical constructions have beenlimited to simple domains such as intervals and rectangles. In thispaper we present a wavelet construction for scalar functions definedon the sphere. We show how biorthogonal wavelets with customproperties can be constructed with the lifting scheme. The basesare extremely easy to implement and allow fully adaptive subdivi-sions. We give examples of functions defined on the sphere, suchas topographic data, bidirectional reflection distribution functions,and illumination, and show how they can be efficiently representedwith spherical wavelets.},

@article{Driscoll:1994,
	Abstract = {This paper considers the problem of efficient computation of the spherical harmonic expansion, or Fourier transform, of functions defined on the two dimensional sphere, S2. The resulting algorithms are applied to the efficient computation of convolutions of functions on the sphere. We begin by proving convolution theorems generalizing well known and useful results from the abelian case. These convolution theorems are then used to develop a sampling theorem on the sphere. which reduces the calculation of Fourier transforms and convolutions of band-limited functions to discrete computations. We show how to perform these efficiently, starting with an O(n(log n)2) time algorithm for computing the Legendre transform of a function defined on the interval [-1,1] sampled at n points there. Theoretical and experimental results on the effects of finite precision arithmetic are presented. The Legendre transform algorithm is then generalized to obtain an algorithm for the Fourier transform, requiring O(n(log n)2) time, and an algorithm for its inverse in O(n1.5) time, where n is the number of points on the sphere at which the function is sampled. This improves the naive O(n2) bound, which is the best previously known. These transforms give an O(n1.5) algorithm for convolving two functions on the sphere.},

The approach is equivalent to Gaussian smoothing on the sphere and is computationally efficient since it does not require iterative smoothing. Furthermore, it does not suffer from the well-known shrinkage problem. Evolution of important shape features (parabolic curves) under diffusion is demonstrated. A nonlinear modification of the diffusion process is introduced in order to improve smoothing behavior of elongated and poorly centered objects.},

	Abstract = {A convolution of the all-sky survey data with a smoothing function is crucial in calculating the smooth surface brightness of the sky survey data. The convolution is usually performed using a spherical version of the convolution theorem. However, a Gaussian function, applicable only in the flat-sky approximation, has been usually adopted as a smoothing kernel. In this paper, we present an exact analytic solution of the spherical-harmonics transformation of a Fisher-von Mises function, the mathematical version of a Gaussian function in spherical space. We also obtain the approximate solutions $\exp[-l(l+1)/2\kappa]$. The exact and the approximate solutions may be useful when an astrophysical survey map is convolved with a smoothing function of $\kappa\gtrsim1$.},

This revolution is the subject of Joseph Dauben's important study the most thorough yet written of the philosopher and mathematician who was once called a ``corrupter of youth'' for an innovation that is now a vital component of elementary school curricula. Set theory has been widely adopted in mathematics and philosophy, but the controversy surrounding it at the turn of the century remains of great interest. Cantor's own faith in his theory was partly theological. His religious beliefs led him to expect paradoxes in any concept of the infinite, and he always retained his belief in the utter veracity of transfinite set theory. Later in his life, he was troubled by recurring attacks of severe depression. Dauben shows that these played an integral part in his understanding and defense of set theory.},

	Abstract = {We pose and solve the analogue of Slepian's time-frequency concentration problem on the surface of the unit sphere to determine an orthogonal family of strictly bandlimited functions that are optimally concentrated within a closed region of the sphere or, alterna- tively, of strictly spacelimited functions that are optimally concentrated in the spherical harmonic domain. Such a basis of simultaneously spatially and spectrally concentrated functions should be a useful data analysis and representation tool in a variety of geophysi- cal and planetary applications, as well as in medical imaging, computer science, cosmology, and numerical analysis. The spherical Slepian functions can be found by solving either an algebraic eigenvalue problem in the spectral domain or a Fredholm integral equation in the spatial domain. The associated eigenvalues are a measure of the spatiospectral concen- tration. When the concentration region is an axisymmetric polar cap, the spatiospectral projection operator commutes with a Sturm-Liouville operator; this enables the eigenfunc- tions to be computed extremely accurately and efficiently, even when their area-bandwidth product, or Shannon number, is large. In the asymptotic limit of a small spatial region and a large spherical harmonic bandwidth, the spherical concentration problem reduces to its planar equivalent, which exhibits self-similarity when the Shannon number is kept invariant.},

@article{Dahlen:2008,
	Abstract = {We address the problem of estimating the spherical-harmonic power spectrum of a statistically isotropic scalar signal from noise-contaminated data on a region of the unit sphere. Three different methods of spectral estimation are considered: (i) the spherical analogue of the one-dimensional (1-D) periodogram, (ii) the maximum-likelihood method and (iii) a spherical analogue of the 1-D multitaper method. The periodogram exhibits strong spectral leakage, especially for small regions of area A\ll 4pi, and is generally unsuitable for spherical spectral analysis applications, just as it is in 1-D. The maximum-likelihood method is particularly useful in the case of nearly-whole-sphere coverage, A\approx4pi, and has been widely used in cosmology to estimate the spectrum of the cosmic microwave background radiation from spacecraft observations. The spherical multitaper method affords easy control over the fundamental trade-off between spectral resolution and variance, and is easily implemented regardless of the region size, requiring neither non-linear iteration nor large-scale matrix inversion. As a result, the method is ideally suited for most applications in geophysics, geodesy or planetary science, where the objective is to obtain a spatially localized estimate of the spectrum of a signal from noisy data within a pre-selected and typically small region.},

@article{Wieczorek:2005,
	Abstract = {It is often advantageous to investigate the relationship between two geophysical data sets in the spectral domain by calculating admittance and coherence functions. While there exist powerful Cartesian windowing techniques to estimate spatially localized (cross-)spectral properties, the inherent sphericity of planetary bodies sometimes necessitates an approach based in spherical coordinates. Direct localized spectral estimates on the sphere can be obtained by tapering, or multiplying the data by a suitable windowing function, and expanding the resultant field in spherical harmonics. The localization of a window in space and its spectral bandlimitation jointly determine the quality of the spatiospectral estimation. Two kinds of axisymmetric windows are here constructed that are ideally suited to this purpose: bandlimited functions that maximize their spatial energy within a cap of angular radius \theta_0, and spacelimited functions that maximize their spectral power within a spherical harmonic bandwidth $L$. Both concentration criteria yield an eigenvalue problem that is solved by an orthogonal family of data tapers, and the properties of these windows depend almost entirely upon the space--bandwidth product $N_0=(L+1)\theta_0/\pi$. The first $N_0-1$ windows are near perfectly concentrated, and the best-concentrated window approaches a lower bound imposed by a spherical uncertainty principle. In order to make robust localized estimates of the admittance and coherence spectra between two fields on the sphere, we propose a method analogous to Cartesian multitaper spectral analysis that uses our optimally concentrated data tapers. We show that the expectation of localized (cross-)power spectra calculated using our data tapers is nearly unbiased for stochastic processes when the input spectrum is white and when averages are made over all possible realizations of the random variables. In physical situations, only one realization of such a process will be available, but in this case, a weighted average of the spectra obtained using multiple data tapers well approximates the expected spectrum. While developed primarily to solve problems in planetary science, our method has applications in all areas of science that investigate spatiospectral relationships between data fields defined on a sphere.},

@article{Simons:1997,
	Abstract = {We develop a method for spatio-spectral localization of harmonic data on a sphere and use it to interpret recent high-resolution global estimates of the gravity and topography of Venus in the context of geodynamical models. Our approach applies equally to the simple spatial windowing of harmonic data and to variable-length-scale analyses, which are analogous to a wavelet transform in the Cartesian domain. Using the variable-length-scale approach, we calculate the localized RMS amplitudes of gravity and topography, as well as the spectral admittance between the two fields, as functions of position and wavelength. The observed admittances over 10 per cent of the surface of Venus (highland plateaus and tessera regions) are consistent with isostatic compensation of topography by variations in crustal thickness, while admittances over the remaining 90 per cent of the surface (rises, plains and lowlands) indicate that long-wavelength topography is dominantly the result of vertical convective tractions at the base of the lithosphere. The global average crustal thickness is less than 30 km, but can reach values as large as 40 km beneath tesserae and highland plateaus. We also note that an Earth-like radial viscosity structure cannot be rejected by the gravity and topography data and that, without a mechanical model of the lithosphere, admittance values cannot constrain the thickness of the thermal boundary layer of Venus. Modelling the lithosphere as a thin elastic plate indicates that at the time of formation of relief in highland plateaus and tesserae, the effective elastic plate thickness, Te, was less than 20 km. Estimates of Te at highland rises are consistently less than 30 km. Our inability to find regions with Te > 30 km is inconsistent with predictions made by a class of catastrophic resurfacing models.},

@article{Audet:2011,
	Abstract = {The spectral relations (admittance and correlation) between gravity and topography are often used to obtain information on the density structure, flexural support, and heat flow of planetary lithospheres. Mapping spatial variations in these quantities requires spatiospectral analysis techniques. Here we describe the application of a directional, continuous spherical wavelet transform using a wavelet basis constructed from the superposition of azimuthally adjacent complex Morlet wavelets, in a manner similar to the ``fan'' wavelet developed in the plane. The method is applied to gravity and topography of the Earth, Venus, Mars, and the Moon. The wavelet coefficients are used to compute isotropic and directional wavelet autospectra and cross spectra, which are then combined to form the admittance and correlation functions. The resulting maps offer insights into lithospheric structure of the terrestrial planets. In particular we show that the Earth and Venus have uniformly low positive admittance and high correlation, whereas Mars and the Moon display hemispherical contrasts with large negative and anisotropic coefficients coinciding with lowlands. As has long been known, the two largest impact basins in the inner solar system, the South Pole-Aitken basin on the Moon and the Hellas basin on Mars, display low positive admittance and high correlation, indicating isostatic compensation. In contrast, most other impact basins, particularly the Martian and lunar mascons, show negative coefficients at low wavelet degrees suggesting flexural support by a strong lithosphere. These results imply that, although simple isotropic flexural models can account for most observations, future models may need to incorporate anisotropy as an additional parameter.},

@article{Han:2007,
	Abstract = {Filtering is critical for representing detail, such as color textures or normal maps, across a variety of scales. While MIP-mapping texture maps is commonplace, accurate normal map filtering remains a challenging problem because of nonlinearities in shading---we cannot simply average nearby surface normals. In this paper, we show analytically that normal map filtering can be formalized as a spherical convolution of the normal distribution function (NDF) and the BRDF, for a large class of common BRDFs such as Lambertian, microfacet and factored measurements. This theoretical result explains many previous filtering techniques as special cases, and leads to a generalization to a broader class of measured and analytic BRDFs. Our practical algorithms leverage a significant body of work that has studied lighting-BRDF convolution. We show how spherical harmonics can be used to filter the NDF for Lambertian and low-frequency specular BRDFs, while spherical von Mises-Fisher distributions can be used for high-frequency materials.},

@article{Yu:2007,
	Abstract = {In vivo quantification of neuroanatomical shape variations is possible due to recent advances in medical imaging and has proven useful in the study of neuropathology and neurodevelopment. In this paper, we apply a spherical wavelet transformation to extract shape features of cortical surfaces reconstructed from magnetic resonance images (MRIs) of a set of subjects. The spherical wavelet transformation can characterize the underlying functions in a local fashion in both space and frequency, in contrast to spherical harmonics that have a global basis set. We perform principal component analysis (PCA) on these wavelet shape features to study patterns of shape variation within normal population from coarse to fine resolution. In addition, we study the development of cortical folding in newborns using the Gompertz model in the wavelet domain, which allows us to characterize the order of development of large-scale and finer folding patterns independently. Given a limited amount of training data, we use a regularization framework to estimate the parameters of the Gompertz model to improve the prediction performance on new data. We develop an efficient method to estimate this regularized Gompertz model based on the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shannon (BFGS) approximation. Promising results are presented using both PCA and the folding development model in the wavelet domain. The cortical folding development model provides quantitative anatomic information regarding macroscopic cortical folding development and may be of potential use as a biomarker for early diagnosis of neurologic deficits in newborns.},

	Abstract = {Wavelets on the sphere are reintroduced and further developed independently of the original group theoretic formalism, in an equivalent, but more straightforward approach. These developments are motivated by the interest of the scale-space analysis of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies on the sky. A new, self-consistent, and practical approach to wavelet filtering on the sphere is developed. It is also established that the inverse stereo- graphic projection of a wavelet on the plane (i.e., Euclidean wavelet) leads to a wavelet on the sphere (i.e., spherical wavelet). This new correspondence principle simplifies the construction of wavelets on the sphere and allows the transfer onto the sphere of properties of wavelets on the plane. In that regard, we define and develop the notions of directionality and steerability of filters on the sphere. In the context of the CMB analysis, these notions are important tools for the identification of local directional features in the wavelet coefficients of the signal and for their interpre- tation as possible signatures of non-Gaussianity, statistical anisotropy, or foreground emission. However, the generic results exposed may find numerous applications beyond cosmology and astrophysics.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents procedures for the explicit parametric representation and global description of surfaces of simply connected 3-D objects. The novel techniques overcome severe limitations of earlier methods (restriction to star-shaped objects (D. H. Ballard and Ch. M. Brown, Computer Vision, Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ, 1981), constraints on positioning and shape of cross-sections (F. Solina and R. Bajcsy, IEEE Trans. Pattern Anal. Much.

SPIE 108, pp. 90-104, 1992), and nonhomogeneous distribution of parameter space). We parametrize the surface by defining a continuous, one-to-one mapping from the surface of the original object to the surface of a unit sphere. The parametrization is formulated as a constrained optimization problem. Practicable starting values are obtained by an initial mapping based on a heat conduction model. The parametrization enables us to expand the object surface into a series of spherical harmonic functions, extending to 3-D the concept of elliptical Fourier descriptors for 2-D closed curves (E. Persoon and K. S. Fu, IEEE Trans. Syst. Man Cybernetics 7(3), 1977, 388-397; F. P. Kuhl and Ch. R. Giardina, Comput. Graphics Image Process. 18(3), 1982, 236-258). Invariant, object-centered descriptors are obtained by rotating the parameter net and the object into standard positions. The new methods are illustrated with 3-D test objects. Potential applications are recognition, classification, and comparison of convoluted surfaces or parts of surfaces of 3-D shapes.},
